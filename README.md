## Question 1

### Can you explain big O notation and why it's important?

### When writing a piece of code, it's important to consider how long it takes for it to run in the worst case scenario. We approximate the overall time complexity according to what the size of the expected inputs. This helps us measure how efficient our code is, especially when scaling applications, and helps us decide what tradeoffs we should or shouldn't be making.
